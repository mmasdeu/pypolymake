- how can we pass the options to the polytope constructor like
  "cyclic(d, n;  Options)" where options are start and spherical?

- how to access to the "fake" perl properties of polytopes like DIM,
  AMBIENT_DIM, etc?

- how do we access (from C++) to the raw documentation strings?

- the function to generate predefined polytope does not seem to
  be declared in a header file... it would be nice to be able
  to use some auto-generation of the documentation
